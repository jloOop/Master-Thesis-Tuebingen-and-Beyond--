# Master Thesis Tübingen and Beyond — YBCO Josephson Ratchet Portfolio

Public superconducting-device R&D portfolio archive connected to MSc-era YBCO Josephson diode / Josephson-ratchet work at the University of Tübingen and later setup-level readout/instrumentation documentation.

This repository is meant as a compact inspection point for cryogenic I-V / IVC analysis, `Ic(H)` / `Ic(Icoil)` asymmetry extraction, AC-drive and quasistatic Gaussian/noise-drive rectification calculations from measured IVCs, loaded-ratchet `Pout` / `Pin` / `η` analysis, measurement-chain reasoning, and cryogenic dipstick documentation.

## Visual overview

| Area | What it shows | Fast entry point |
|---|---|---|
| Device characterization | `Ic(Icoil)`, asymmetric IVCs, `Ic+`/`Ic−`, optimum-field asymmetry, and `Vdc(Iac)` context. | `notebooks/01_chip_characterization.ipynb ; 02_sine_drive_rectification.ipynb`; `docs/experimental-rd-highlights/` |
| Rectification calculations | Measured asymmetric IVC → deterministic sine-drive rectification and loaded-ratchet `Pout` / `Pin` / `η`. | `notebooks/02_sine_drive_rectification.ipynb` |
| Gaussian/noise-drive calculations | Quasistatic Gaussian/noise-drive rectification calculated from measured IVCs; not final direct external-noise operation. | `notebooks/03_gaussian_drive_rectification.ipynb`; `docs/future-noise-operation/` |
| Readout and instrumentation | ADC/noise-chain FFT/PSD diagnostics, current-source / voltage-amplifier / generator context, and cryogenic dipstick documentation. | `docs/instrumentation/`; `docs/instrumentation/noise-characterization/`; `docs/instrumentation/dc-dipstick/` |

## Key outputs and symbols

- **Device:** YBCO Josephson diode / Josephson ratchet using in-line Josephson-junction geometry.
- **Core measured objects:** cryogenic IVC / I-V curves; `Ic+`, `Ic−`; `Ic(H)` / `Ic(Icoil)`; rectified `Vdc(Iac)`.
- **Publication-reported figures of merit:** critical-current asymmetry `A ≈ 7`, rectified voltage up to `212 µV`, output power up to `0.2 nW`, thermodynamic efficiency up to about `75%`, essential device area around `1 µm²`.
- **Power/efficiency quantities:** `Pout = Vdc · Idc`, `Pin = (1/T)∫V(t)I(t)dt`, `η = -Pout/Pin`.
- **Noise boundary:** Gaussian/noise-drive material here is quasistatic calculation and setup/readout preparation; it is not a claim that a final direct external-noise Josephson-ratchet experiment was completed.

## Representative workflows

### 1. Cryogenic IVC and critical-current asymmetry

The chip-characterization workflow examines cryogenic I-V / IVC data, extracts positive and negative critical currents, and identifies magnetic-field / coil-current working points with strong critical-current asymmetry.

### 2. Deterministic AC-drive rectification

The sine-drive workflow uses measured asymmetric IVCs to calculate rectified DC voltage curves under quasistatic sinusoidal drive and loaded-ratchet operation.

### 3. Gaussian/noise-drive calculations

The Gaussian/noise-drive workflow evaluates quasistatic rectification, output power, input power, and efficiency from measured IVCs under stochastic-drive assumptions.

### 4. Measurement-chain preparation

The instrumentation and future-noise-operation folders document setup-level noise-source identification, ADC / generator / current-source / voltage-amplifier configurations, resistor and dipstick noise diagnostics, and cryogenic measurement hardware context.

## Minimal local setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

The notebooks are public inspection and research-analysis material. Some notebook cells may still depend on thesis-era data paths or local saved data. Legacy acquisition scripts may require original lab hardware and are not a maintained instrument-control package.

## Scope and contribution boundaries

This repository supports claims about superconducting-device analysis, cryogenic I-V / IVC interpretation, critical-current asymmetry, rectification calculations, loaded-ratchet output/input power, thermodynamic efficiency, measurement-chain reasoning, and cryogenic/instrumentation documentation.

It should **not** be used to claim sole fabrication ownership, sole He-FIB operation, full cleanroom process ownership, completed final direct noise-driven Josephson-ratchet operation, production software engineering, commercial instrument-control software, custom low-noise amplifier design, full RF/microwave engineering ownership, certified electronics design, full cryostat design, or industrial quantum-device production ownership.
